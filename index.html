              In our digital age, we are in change of shaping who we are online.
              When it comes to entering the tech industry, this is even more
              important given the nature of this work. Futher, the value of a
              portfolio that showcases not only your technical experience but
              your personality and purpose is powerful. The objective of a
              customizable, digital mini gallery is to provide a platform that
              integrates the ability to showcase something more unique about an
              applicant as well as their development skills using
              React/JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Further, the interactivity of the
              gallery through filtering, sorting, and favoriting allows for a
              more engaging experience for the user and increases the
              memorability of ones portfolio.

              To start brainstorming, I started by looking at what's already out
              there in terms of favoriting functions. I focused my competitive
              analysis on the following three interfaces. Interact with these
              interfaces directly by clicking on them below.

            <p class="proj-body">
              Through conducting a competitive comparison on these three
              platform features, I found that while each one shares the same
              factors on a higher level, the implementation of such features are
              tuned for the underlying purposes of each company. Specifically,
              Amazon is a marketplace that mainly relies on you purchasing items
              incrementally, whereas Netflix and Spotify want you to continue
              your monthly subscription year over year.
            </p>
            <h3>üé• Netflix "My List"</h3>
            <p class="proj-body">
              Netflix's "My List" feature focuses on simplicity, allowing
              one-click adding and removing of shows/movies. To avoid
              cluttering, personalized recommendations are only given through
              the ‚ÄúMore Like This Feature‚Äù when a specific title is selected.
              However, there are no options for filtering, sorting, or sharing
              content within the list, hurting selection efficiency.
            </p>
            <h3>üõí Amazon "Lists"</h3>
            <p class="proj-body">
              In contrast, Amazon's "Lists" feature provides much more robust
              capabilities like filtering, sorting, sharing entire lists or
              specific items, and personalized recommendations based on the
              user's list. However, it overcomplicates adding an item to a list
              by making the user first go to the item‚Äôs page, scrolling down the
              page, and clicking a barely-visible ‚ÄúAdd to List‚Äù button. This
              process does not apply to Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù or ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù
              buttons, which are vibrantly colored yellow or orange and require
              only a single click.
            </p>
            <h3>üé∂ Spotify "Liked Songs"</h3>
            <p class="proj-body">
              Finding a middle ground, Spotify's "Liked Songs" feature allows
              one-click adding and removing, with extensive filtering options by
              genre and sorting by title, album, date added, and duration. This
              perfectly fits the use cases of quickly adding or removing a song
              as you are listening and of efficiently finding music to listen
              to. The genre filter options are hierarchically delineated,
              however only one genre can be applied at a time. Recommendations
              are added only when a user wants so that they do not clutter the
              interface.
            </p>
            <p class="proj-body">
              Overall, I found that Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄúMy List‚Äù is an oversimplified
              aggregator due to the lack of filtering and sorting functionality.
              Further, Amazon‚Äôs cluttered ‚ÄúLists‚Äù interface made a simple task
              overly complicated. On the other hand, Spotify‚Äôs cleverly
              filterable and sortable interface for ‚ÄúLiked Songs‚Äù struck the
              best balance for the purpose of the feature: for a user to view
              and browse all of their liked songs.

            <h2>Feature List</h2>
            <p class="proj-body">
              For my interface, I am building a digital gallery for my origami
              creations, which I have made myself over the past few years. I
              hope for this gallery to grow over time, amassing all of my
              origami pieces, and for it to serve as part of my portfolio that
              not only showcases my React dev skills but also an artistic hobby
              that I love. Given my positive takeaways from Spotify‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiked
              Songs‚Äù interface and similar purpose to my origami gallery, I hope
              to draw the most inspiration from this interface and implement
              similar features, listed below.

              When starting sketching, I started with the individual cards, as I
              knew the interface would build from those primary components. I
              drew out the "like" interaction, which was designed relative to
              the convention standardized by other social media platforms to
              invoke users' recognition. The interface is hierarchical, with the
              filters appearing first and then the gallery of origami pieces
              below. The likes aggregator gathers items in a column to create
              visual difference from the gallery in addition to line separator.
              Sketching out the full interface gave me a thorough mental model
              of what I wanted to accomplish in the low-fidelity wireframes.
            </p>
            <h2 class="space-bottom">Low-fidelity Wireframes</h2>

            <p class="proj-body space-bottom">
              The low-fidelity wireframes were essential in the process of
              translating the design to a more uniform layout to make sure I was
              implementing my desired features without cluttering the interface.
              Then, I was able to move onto making all of my ideas come to life
              in the high-fidelity wireframes, accompanied by the style guide.

              through neutral colors and a clean layout. One change that was
              made between the low-fidelity and high-fidelity versions was the
              coloring of the filter and sort buttons, which aim to delineate
              filtering and sorting to decrease the need for a user to recall
              which is which.

            <p class="proj-body">
              I found this project to be helpful in refining my React skills and
              it also allowed me to create a gallery for my origami creations,
              which I've wanted to do for a while! I also really enjoyed
              completing the end-to-end design process, from research to
              prototyping and iterating with feedback from Responsive Redesign.
              I'm really excited to add this page to my final portfolio website
              to showcase my favorite hobby and for others to use this gallery
              to display their own art that they're passionate about creating!
